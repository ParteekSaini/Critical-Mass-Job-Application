# Work/Projects Examples
This is list of few recent project/work examples

<h2>Devasya</h2><br/>
Devasya is the most recent and one of the most complex project that I have worked on, built using React.js as Front-End, Django as Back-End, and MySQL as Database, infact I am currently working on this project. This is the first time in my career when I am independently and dirctly working with client and understanding their needs and executing them in best possible ways in project. The aim of this project is to create a website suitable for all access devices (Laptops, and mobiles) rendering IT services of my client to their clients and/or to any company who are looking for software solutions. In other words, this website is a marketing medium of  my client to showcase their offered IT services to possible clients and a medium to do business with existing clients as well. I am working as one of two Full-Stack Development member in this project. I created front-end user interface in React.js by using components and routing. I have also created Web APIs using Django rest-framework, and Serializers and intergrated them with React using Axios. I have also implemented token based user/admin authentication. The features that I am currently working on are Invoice Generation, a dedicated Dashboard for database(MySQL) for the purpose of data-analysis, and deployment of this webite on a live server.<br/>

<h2>International Student Guide</h2><br/>
My Advance Web Programming course's final project was International Student Guide. It was a group project with a partner and both of us worked as developers in this project. The aim of this project was to provide guidance to international students who aspire to come to Canada and/or who are new to Canada. This project was divided into sections where each section will concenrate on soving a specific issue that one can encouter. For example, one section for filtered college list and methods to obtain offer letter for various colleges in Canada, another section to simplify the process of "How to apply visa" and obtain supporting documents which one might need, and finally one dedicated section for students to book rooms with students who are already in Canada which would cut down their expenses by more than 40%. All of these features were designed, and implemented using React.js as Front-end, Node.js as Back-end and MongoDB as Database. I also used Rest-APIs in this projects for data tranfer and communication between front-end and back-end. Finally, we deployed this application on AWS using Ubuntu server and Nginx.<br/>

<h2>NutriGuide</h2><br/>
I made this project during one of course at Douglas College. This was a personal project built using HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript. The challange of this project was to create a respnsive web application without using external libraries such as BootStrap etc. The objective of this project was to create a fitness web app capable of guiding a user who is new in fitness and nutrition world. The inspriation behind this project was personal as I am real fitness freak. I used HTML5 and CSS3 for desiging and styling of my user interface respectively. Other than that, I also used media queries to make this app responsive for Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile Phones meaning this app had 3 different user interafces catered towards 3 different types of devices. Moreover, I used Javascript for input authentication and validation for 2 types of forms. One form was designed to showcase user their calarie requirments based on their Age, Gender, Height, Weight, and their fitness goal and another form was desinged to provide meal options. This was a simple but effective project that I have made recently with limitations in technologies but I am proud that I still made a wonderful app nonetheless.<br/>

# Inspiration
This section is to explain projects or work that recently inspired me.

<h2>Self Updating Google Maps</h2>
I came across self updating feature of google maps recently and did not realized up until that google maps updated itself using advancements in AI and imagery.
Over the past few years, businesses have experienced a lot of change â€” including constantly updating operating hours based on changing pandemic-related restrictions. To keep up with this pace of change, google developed a machine learning model that automatically identifies if business hours are likely wrong, then instantly updates them with AI-generated predictions. This algorithm analyze the other nearby shops, information from a spefific shop's website, and its street view images to specifically look for business hour signs to determine the most accurate business hour prediction. Simultaneously, in countries like Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, and the United States, google also use Duplex conversational technology(An AI System for Accomplishing Real-World Tasks Over the Phone) to call businesses and ask for their hours directly. Google is also using AI to bring the most up-to-date road related information such as  speed limit changes, road closures.For example, with the help of third-party imagery partners that already gather roadway imagery to improve delivery routes, google can request a photo of the specific stretch of road that also includes a speed limit sign. If the partner has this photo available, google then use a combination of AI and help from operations team to identify the sign in the image, extract the new speed limit information, and update Google Maps. This is highly effective use of AI and imagery to solve real world problems, therefore, I was highly inspired from this project of Google.

<h2>React by Meta</h2>
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is one the most widely used front-end technologies used in today's web development world. I would like to highlight few of its features that have redefined and simplified web development. Firstly, React is declarative that makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when data changes. Declarative views make code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. Secondly, component-based nature of this library that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, a developer can easily pass rich data through his/her app and keep state out of the DOM. Lastly, one can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native. This is a highly useful open-source front-end JavaScript library which have inspired me to a point that I made 2 React projects during my program at Douglas College. The current project(Devasya) that I am working on has its front-end in React which I have described above as well. The last inspiration that this library gave me is "learn once, write anywhere", meaning re-writable code that can be used anywhere, anytime.
